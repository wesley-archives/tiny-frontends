# Tiny Frontend Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of tiny frontend projects! This repository is a space to store small experiments and ideas using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some are old, some are new â€” all are built just for fun or practice.

## Projects

You'll find a variety of small, self-contained frontend examples like sliders, theme toggles, UI components, and more.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the folders and check out the code. Each project is standalone and can be opened directly in your browser.

## License

This repository is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
